# Node-Child

## Hi!
this repo is about creating child processes in node.js.
As you may already know (if not, i'm telling you right now!) nodejs use a event-based model, instead of thread-based. 
Long story short, we could say that node is a single thread process, which in modern multicore and multi thread cpus may be a great limitation. How can we pass this limit? By making us a family :D se need more child.....process child! Exactly like in the old (but gold) c and c++! This repo is exactly about that, apply the information i got from these 2 guides and create a test application, in order to learn and master this feature of node, to be able to apply it to my other projects as well.
